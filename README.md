# Server Testing
Topics:
  * API Specification Design
  * Test Driven Development
  * Async Testing with Mocha

## Description
Up to this point you've learned about client side testing, but now we're going to break you into the world of testing an API. The flow of this project will be to design your own API specification, write tests for that API, and then build out that API. What you will gain from this is a sense of common practices for building a maintainable API.

## Setting up the Project
- Run `npm install --save express body-parser`.
- Run `npm install --save-dev mocha chai chai-http`.
